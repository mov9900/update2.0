```html
<!-- EDUSHELF AI Chatbot -->
<div id="chatbot-toggle" class="chatbot-toggle">
    <div class="toggle-icon">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor">

        </svg>
    </div>
    <div class="notification-dot" id="notification-dot"></div>
</div>

<div id="chatbot-container" class="chatbot-container">
    <!-- Full chatbot HTML structure here -->
    <!-- Copy from chatbot.html -->

```

#### Option B: Global Integration
Add the chatbot to ALL pages by including it in a common header/footer file.

### Step 3: Update Firebase Rules (Optional)
Add these Firestore security rules to handle chat data:

```javascript
// Firestore Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /chatHistory/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```
